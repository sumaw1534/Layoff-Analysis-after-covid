This project focuses on Employee layoff data analytics which is the examination of data related to workforce reductions to gain insights into the reasons, effects, and outcomes of layoffs. The analytics includes data on employee demographics, job performance, organizational structure, financial performance, and workforce trends. The purpose of this analytics is to understand the factors that contribute to layoffs and to evaluate the impact of layoffs on the organization and its employees. The results of the analytics can inform decisions on layoffs, help to minimize the impact of workforce reductions, and provide a basis for planning for future workforce needs. The methods used in employee layoff data analytics includes statistical analysis, machine learning models for prediction and data visualization. This work will help both the freshers as well as the employees who are associated with the specific company.
